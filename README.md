Just some random stuff about Data Structures, just my way exclusively in JAVA.
   
Starting off with Java and trying to master the language sweeping every corner that meets my eye.

The programs are as follows:

1) Matrix.java - This is a simple java program that explains the usage of Matrix addition, subtraction and multiplication 
   in a good MENU like format, do check it out for more fun with the code.


2) Search.java - This is a simple menu like program that deals with two of the search algorithms and their implementation in java, 
   which are linear search and binary search, the code is heavily commented especially so that amateur programmers can understand the        steps.
   
   
3) Stack.java - This is the beginner friendly program, an entry level program for the interested amateur programmers enthusiastic about      learning data structures while implementing them in a program. Starting point of data structures for beginners.


4) Queue.java - Again a beginner friendly, entry level data structure program following the stack algorithm is the queue algorithm,
   Easier to implement and understand the movement of data with the help of arrays, exact opposite to stack in implementation and            underlying core functions.


5) Selection.java - Selection sort is one of hundreds of other sorting algorithms. Understanding this simple algorithm about placing the      elements according to their hierarchy either ascending or descending (I have only presented the ascending method of sorting). If anyone    wants to do the other way round doing the descending method, go ahead and try, also anybody can contact me regarding this.
