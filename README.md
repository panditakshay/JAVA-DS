# JAVA-DS
Just some random stuff about Data Structures, just my way exclusively in JAVA.

Starting off with Java and trying to master the language sweeping every corner that meets my eye.

The programs are as follows: 

1) Matrix.java - This is a simple java program that explains the usage of Matrix addition, subtraction and multiplication in a good MENU      like format, do check it out for more fun with the code.

2) Search.java - This is a simple menu like program that deals with two of the search algorithms and their implementation in java, which      are linear search and binary searhc, the code is heavily commented especially so that amateur programmers can understand the steps.
